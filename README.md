# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Visualization-with-Folium
Description:

This repository contains Python code for visualizing solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a map of India using Folium, a Python library for creating interactive maps. The TSP is a classic problem in computer science where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting town.

Features:

Implements the nearest neighbour algorithm to find an approximate solution to the TSP.
Allows users to register/log in to view the TSP animation on the map.
Provides interactive visualization of city locations and the optimized tour route.
Demonstrates using Folium and NumPy libraries for map creation and mathematical computations.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (NumPy, Folium).
Run the Python script to generate the TSP animation on the map.
Register or log in to view the animation and explore the optimized tour route.
